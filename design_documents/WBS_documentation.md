MugGWAS project modules

- Activity 1: Project Planning
  - Activity 1.1: Set up a GitHub repository
    - [X] Task 1.1.1: Create the repository and invite team members
    - [X] Task 1.1.2: Create description documents: SRS, DDS, WBS and datasets
    - [X] Task 1.1.3: Define data structure
  - Activity 1.2: Find testing datasets
    - [X] Task 1.2.1: Define inputs and outputs and describe data requirements.
    - [X] Task 1.2.2: Download data and check accessibility.
  - Activity 1.3: Write documentation
    - [X] Task 1.3.1: Describe tool functionalities, usage, and prerequisites in the SRS.
    - [X] Task 1.3.2: Describe code modules and data flow in the DDS.
    - [ ] Task 1.3.3: Plan activities in the WBS.
- Activity 2: Build prototype I
  - Activity 2.1: Define modules and functionalities
    - [X] Task 2.1.1: Break project into modules
    - [X] Task 2.1.2: Define scripts for each module
  - Activity 2.2: Define high-level functions for modules
    - [ ] Task 2.2.1: Define read data function
    - [ ] Task 2.2.2: Define analysis function
    - [ ] Task 2.2.3: Define save output function
  - Activity 2.3: Implement functions in Module 1 - compile_variants_by_gene 
    - [ ] Task 2.3.1: Implement read data function
    - [ ] Task 2.3.2: Implement one analysis function - compile variants on a per gene basis for each sample.
    - [ ] Task 2.3.3: Implement one analysis function - determine the type of mutations each variant is causing.
    - [] Task 2.3.4: Implement save output function
  - Activity 2.4: Test prototype
- Activity 3: Build prototype II
  - Activity 3.1: Implement functions in Module 2 - summarize_mutated_genes 
    - [ ] Task 3.1.1: Implement read data function - read output from the last module
    - [ ] Task 3.1.2: Implement one analysis function - determine if a gene is mutated based on the annotation.
      - [ ] This step will require more discussion. What is considered a mutated gene? A premature stop codon, non-synonymous mutation, exonic mutation, etc.
    - [] Task 3.1.3: Implement save output function - output a table that summarizes the mutation status (mutated/unmutated) for each gene and sample.
