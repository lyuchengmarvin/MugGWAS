MugGWAS project modules

- Activity 1: Project Planning
 - Activity 1.1: Set up a GitHub repository
  - [X] Task 1.1.1: Create the repository and invite team members
  - [X] Task 1.1.2: Create description documents: SRS, DDS, WBS and datasets
  - [X] Task 1.1.3: Define data structure
 - Activity 1.2: Find testing datasets
  - [X] Task 1.2.1: Define inputs and outputs and describe data requirements.
  - [X] Task 1.2.2: Download data and check accessibility.
 - Activity 1.3: Write documentation
  - [X] Task 1.3.1: Describe tool functionalities, usage, and prerequisites in the SRS.
  - [X] Task 1.3.2: Describe code modules and data flow in the DDS.
  - [ ] Task 1.3.3: Plan activities in the WBS.
- Activity 2: Build prototype I
  - Activity 2.1: Define modules and functionalities
    - [ ] Task 2.1.1: Break project into activities
    - [ ] Task 2.1.2: Break project into tasks
  - Activity 2.2: Define high-level functions
    - [ ] Task 2.2.1: Define read/create data function
    - [ ] Task 2.2.2: Define analysis function
    - [ ] Task 2.2.3: Define save output function
  - Activity 2.3: Implement read data and save the output and one feature in the analysis
    - [ ] Task 2.3.1: Implement read/create data function
    - [ ] Task 2.3.2: Implement one analysis function: compute profile score for 1 TCGA sample 
      - [ ] The first implementation of this function will be with a mockup input (like two numbers) and a simple output - the difference 
      - [ ] The next step is to have a proper input in the correct format - just that it will be a scaled up input - just a small matrix 4x2 for instance and for that I compute a simple match score again: the sum of the differences between my sample and my reference profile
    - [] Task 2.3.3: Implement save output function
  - Activity 2.4: Test prototype
- Activity 3: Build prototype II
